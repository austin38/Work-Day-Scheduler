Work-Day-Scheduler
Welcome and enjoy this everday 9am-5pm planner to help organize your time in a simple, yet, helpful method!
Simply place what task/s you have in the certain time block, and press the blue "save" button on the right of the time block.
Once you are done with that task, you can just delete the task and "save" again, or put another task you might have for the next day!
Enjoy
